### Convolution
In image processing, by convolution we mean, putting a matrix over another and then calculating the weighted sum of all pixel values. One of these matrices is an image and the other one is a kernel matrix. The kernel matrix is generally smaller than the image (3x3 is the standard).

The Kernel matrix is moved over the image matrix to get the output matrix as shown below. Here is how the Output Matrix is calculated:

We will see below how different Kernels affect the output image after the process of convolution takes place.
