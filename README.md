External Internship Program - **2.0**  
  
The External Internship Program is a Machine Learning for Deep Neural Networks internship program designed especially for working Professionals, though it is open for learners from all domains.  
  
### The Strategy

The strategy for EIP is to focus more on the HandsOn experience first, and then, take you deeper into concepts. Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning are evolving extremely fast which makes the concepts invented last year, obsolete this year. Therefore we will cover mostly the latest concepts and not spend time on historical stuff not being used in the industry anymore.  
  
### Objectives
EIP has two objectives:

- The first objective of EIP is to **unravel deeper concepts** currently in use in ML algorithms. If you are able to read through a new research paper in a breeze, read it's code and reimplement it with improvements, we will consider that we have achieved our objective.

- The second objective of EIP is to **democratize AI and ML knowledge**. We want to develop a strong ecosystem in India for AI/ML and this directly depends on how many people actually practice it.  
  
### The Phases
EIP Version II is divided into 3 phases. You need to clear the exam at the end of each phase to progress forward. By design, only those who land in the top 70 Percentile will proceed forward.

- Phase I has 4 sessions (covering topics from Basics to CNN)
- Phase II has 4 sessions (covering Advanced CNN and Project)
- Phase III has 6 sessions (covering LSTM and Reinforcement Learning)
